# ThePizzaDude/ip-geolocator @ GitHub.com
This is a slightly modified verion of [@KyxRecon](https://github.com/KyxRecon "View profile")'s IP geolocation tool. I made it for my convenience but I figured I'd put it on my basically empty GitHub.

## "installation"
#### on Wingay
* [install Perl](http://learn.perl.org/installing/windows.html "How to install Perl on Windows")
* open Git Shell
* `cd` into a convenient folder
* type `git clone https://github.com/ThePizzaDude/ip-geolocator.git`
* go back to normal CMD
* `cd` into the new `ip-geolocator` folder
* type `perl ip-geolocator ` and paste a domain name or IP address after it to see if your ~~tireless~~ effortless work actually was worth it
#### another way to get on Wingay
* [install Perl](http://learn.perl.org/installing.windows.html "How to install Perl on Windows")
* [download the fucking zip](https://github.com/Shaypes/ip-geolocator/archive/master.zip "ip-geolocator-master.zip")
* unzip it
* type `cd C:\Users\You\Downloads\ip-geolocator-master`
* type `perl ip-geolocator.pl ` with a domain name or IP address after it to see if it actually fucking works
#### on GNU/Linux (the way the kool kidz do it!!!)
